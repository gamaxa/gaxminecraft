## 0.9
- Added network timeouts to Node so that requests do not hang
- Support for aliases in transfers and leases

## 0.8
- Support for transactions version 2 (compatible with Waves 0.13)
- `Transaction.setProof()` was renamed `withProof()` to better reflect the fact that it doesn't modify the object but rather returns new one
- `char PublicKeyAccount.scheme` was replaced with `byte chainId`
- Introduced `Transaction.getBytes()`

## 0.7
- Support for account scripts
- Added `getBlock()` and `getTransaction()` to `Node`
- Transaction factory methods got overrides that accept `timestamp` parameter
- String entries in Data transactions

## 0.6

Reworked signing and proofs:
- Removed `signers` parameter from factory methods
- Moved `sign` method from `Transaction` to `PrivateKeyAccount`
- In `Transaction`, `addProof(String)` becomes `setProof(int, String)` so that it's possible to create non-contiguous lists of proofs, e.g. define proofs 1 and 3 but leave proof 2 out.

This is a non-compatible change, but hopefully not many people have started using features from version 0.5 given that they are three days old now.

## 0.5

Added multisig support in Transaction. Factory methods now accept PublicKeyAccount for `sender` rather than PrivateKeyAccount, and a separate `signers` array. This is a source-compatible change, however, existing code may need to be recompiled.

Also replaced `signature` with `proofs`, and added methods to add proofs to a transaction.
